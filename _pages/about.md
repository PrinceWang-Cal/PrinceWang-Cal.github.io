Hi, Iâ€™m a fourth-year Computer Science & Statistics undergraduate at the University of California Berkeley. I am mainly interested in machine learning, statistics, and building efficient systems. I recently also became very interested in the financial market and applying machine learning for quantitative analysis. I also love teaching computer science and machine learning. Check out my teaching page for the courses I have taught.

### Industry

I have interned at [UCSF Radiology](https://radiology.ucsf.edu), working on a research project for applying sequential models for CT scan processing. I have also interned at [Rexel](https://www.rexelusa.com/) as a software engineer, developing high-frequency systems for IoT data processing. In 2020, I interned as a Machine Learning engineer at [atHUM](https://athum.com/), focusing on similarity models and pipelines.

### Research

My current research focus is in the field of 3D Computer Vision and Medical Imaging.
I am an undergraduate researcher at Berkeley, where I am advised by Professor [Joey Gonzalez](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/) on machine learning research. I am also an undergraduate researcher at UCSF Radiology, where I am advised by Professor [Jae Ho Sohn](https://radiology.ucsf.edu/people/jae-ho-sohn) in deep learning based on medical imaging research.
