I enjoy teaching and I have joined the following courses as a course staff at Berkeley:

- [CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning, Spring 2022](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/)
- [CS 170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems, Fall 2020](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs170/fa20/)
- [CS 170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems, Spring 2020](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs170/sp20/)

I have also tutored as a Computer Science Mentor in the following course:

- [CS 61B: Data Structure, Spring 2020](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/)

I am currently compiling materials I created for teaching. I might upload them to here one day.
